# Lithology_Prediction
Lithology prediction for Geothermal Resources using Machine Learning

## Project task

Here, we implemented 3 Supervised Learning models namely;
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Multi-Layer Perceptron

In building a hybridized machine learning model (Voting Classifier) for Geothermal Well. This lithologies present can be seen in the Figure below
